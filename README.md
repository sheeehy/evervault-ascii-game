Ascii Puzzle Game!

was happy with how this turned out, but could have spent a lot more time on it.

future stuff to fix or add:

- better key inputs
- better responsiveness
- more micro interactions for buttons, hover effects, etc.
- different difficultys, that change timings, noise/jumbling and points
- more ascii art
- different themes of ascii art
- also wanted to spend more time on the illustration on the game menu
